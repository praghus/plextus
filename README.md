# Plextus [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/praghus/plextus.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/praghus/plextus)

Plextus is a pixel art editor designed to make tiled maps and tilesets. In addition to the usual tile placement, it also allows you to draw directly on map and edit the tiles.

**Plextus is fully compatible with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor and allows you to export your finished project to `.tmx` format.**
